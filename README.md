# Linked List Operations

This project performs various operations on a linked list. These operations include adding elements to the beginning, middle, or end of the list, deleting an element from the list, and searching for an element in the list.

## Operations
-*Insertion*:

Inserting an element at the beginning of the list.
Inserting an element in the middle of the list.
Inserting an element at the end of the list.
-*Deletion*:

Deleting a node from the beginning of the list.
Deleting a node from the middle of the list.
Deleting a node from the end of the list.
-*Search*:

Searching for a specific element in the list.


# Binary Tree Traversal
This project allows traversing a binary tree using different traversal methods (preorder, inorder, postorder) and printing the nodes level by level. Additionally, it calculates the height of the tree and prints the nodes in reverse level order.


# Stack Implementation in C++

This project implements a basic stack data structure in C++. It provides functionality to push elements onto the stack, pop elements from the stack, and print the elements currently present in the stack. The stack is implemented using a linked list.



## Features

- **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
- **Peek**: Returns the value of the top element without removing it from the stack.
- **Print**: Prints all elements present in the stack.
